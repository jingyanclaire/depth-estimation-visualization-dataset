Two models (Model A and Model B) have generated depth predictions for the same RGB image.\n\n**Your task:** Compare the depth estimation quality and determine which model performs better.\n\n**Evaluation aspects:**\n1. **Depth Accuracy**: Which model's depth values are more accurate compared to ground truth?\n2. **Detail Preservation**: Which model better preserves depth boundaries and fine details (e.g., vehicles, road, sky)?\n3. **Structural Consistency**: Which model maintains better scene geometry and spatial relationships in driving scenarios?\n4. **Overall Quality**: Considering all factors, which model provides superior depth estimation for autonomous driving applications?\n\n**Input format:**\n- Image 1: Model A's depth prediction visualization\n- Image 2: Model B's depth prediction visualization\n\n<image>\n<image>\n\n**Metadata:**\nModel A: ZoeDepth-K\n- δ1 score: 0.9545 (95.4%)\n- Category: excellent\n- Depth range: 5.78m - 70.41m (mean: 18.43m)\n\nModel B: Marigold\n- δ1 score: 0.4941 (49.4%)\n- Category: poor\n- Depth range: 0.30m - 71.30m (mean: 35.80m)\n\nGround Truth:\n- Depth range: 5.91m - 84.55m (mean: 18.57m)\n\n**Category Definitions:**\n- Excellent: δ1 ≥ 95%\n- Good: 90% ≤ δ1 < 95%\n- Average: 85% ≤ δ1 < 90%\n- Fair: 80% ≤ δ1 < 85%\n- Acceptable: 70% ≤ δ1 < 80%\n- Poor: δ1 < 70%\n\n**Instructions:**\n1. Analyze both depth predictions carefully\n2. Compare them against the ground truth metrics\n3. Consider the δ1 scores (higher is better, threshold at 0.95 for excellent)\n4. Pay special attention to road surface, vehicles, and distant objects\n5. Provide your final answer\n\n**Required response format:**\nAnswer: [A/B]\n\nOnly respond with 'A' if Model A is better, or 'B' if Model B is better.",
